# About Ibox
Ibox is a operating system project being developed for research and academic purposes. Its intent is to create an operating system capable of supporting future and advancing technologies. One day it may become stable enough to be used in the embedded, high-end desktop, server, mainframe and research markets.

# Build Instructions
Ibox requires a Linux Environemnt to run ([Wiki](https://github.com/beyondsociety/ibox/wiki)) and either a cross-compiler or clang/llvm to build from source. We also now use meson as the build system for ibox, refer to [Howto build Ibox with meson](docs/BuildingIbox.md) for more info.
