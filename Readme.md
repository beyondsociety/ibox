### Development branch for Ibox

Branch repo for development on Ibox, currently working on the bootloaders for ibox and design/layout of the os.

### Build Instructions

Ibox requires a Linux Environemnt to run ([Wiki](https://github.com/beyondsociety/ibox/wiki)) and either a cross-compiler or clang/llvm to build from source. We also now use meson as the build system for ibox, refer to [Howto build Ibox with meson](docs/BuildingIbox.md) for more info.
