# About Ibox
Ibox is a operating system project being developed for research and academic purposes. Its intent is to create an operating system capable of supporting future and advancing technologies. One day it may become stable enough to be used in the embedded, high-end desktop, server, mainframe and research markets.

# Build Instructions
Ibox now uses meson to build and requires either a cross-compiler or clang/llvm tools
