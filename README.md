## **How to use the meson build system**
Meson requires two main dependences to run: \
**Python 3 and Ninja** 

On Ubuntu these can be easily installed with the following command: \
**$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip ninja-build**

The best way to get Meson is to use **pip install** for the user. \
**$ pip3 install --user meson**

You can also get the Meson package from your distro, but beware that due to their frequent release cycle and development speed, the distro version might be out of date. Another option is to clone the git repository and run it directly from there.
